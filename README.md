# OptiReturn – AI-Powered Reverse Logistics Optimization

## Overview

OptiReturn is an AI-driven web application designed to enhance the efficiency of reverse logistics in e-commerce. The system leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of product returns and estimate the resale value of returned items. It provides data-driven insights to help businesses reduce operational losses and maximize profit recovery.

## Features

- **Product Return Prediction**  
  Predict whether a product is likely to be returned using features such as price, delivery time, review score, and customer location.

- **Resale Value Estimation**  
  Estimate the resale price of returned items based on historical product and customer data.

- **Modern User Interface**  
  A sleek, responsive frontend inspired by macOS design principles with glassmorphism effects and dark theme.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Basic user authentication with signup and login functionality.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js (with Vite)
- JavaScript
- HTML5, CSS3
- Responsive design using Flexbox and modern CSS

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost (ML models)
- Pydantic (for data validation)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

### Machine Learning
- **Return Prediction**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Resale Price Estimation**: XGBoost Regressor

## Dataset

The models were trained using a cleaned dataset derived from e-commerce transactions. Important fields used include:
- `price`
- `delivery_time`
- `review_score`
- `freight_value`
- `customer_city`
- `customer_state`
- `order_status`

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                             |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/predict-return/`     | POST   | Predict likelihood of product return    |
| `/predict-resale/`     | POST   | Estimate resale value for a product     |
| `/get-dataset/`        | GET    | Fetch processed data for dropdowns      |

## How to Run

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn app:app --reload



Frontend (React)
	1.	Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend/my-react-app


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Run the development server:

npm run dev
